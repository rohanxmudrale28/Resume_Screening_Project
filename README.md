🚀 **Excited to share my latest Python project: Resume Screening System!**

In today’s fast-paced world, companies receive a flood of resumes, making it almost impossible to manually sift through all the applications. To solve this problem, many MNCs use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes based on specific keywords. However, this often leaves behind great resumes that don’t contain the exact keywords.

I’ve built a solution using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help bridge that gap. Here's how it works:

🔍 **Project Overview**:
- I’ve trained a model on a dataset of resumes.
- The system performs vectorization, sampling, and dataset cleaning to ensure better data quality.
- It uses advanced classifiers like KNeighbors Classifier, SVC, and Random Forest to predict the job title that best matches the resume.

⚙️ **How It Works**:
1. Upload a resume's text.
2. The model analyzes the content.
3. It predicts the most suitable job the person is aiming for, making the recruitment process more accurate and efficient.

✨ This project combines machine learning, data preprocessing, and NLP to revolutionize the way resumes are filtered and categorized.

I believe this could help HR departments reduce bias and find the perfect candidates faster! 💼📈
